### Checkout Times by Gender

This chart is a gender breakdown of the previous chart.  Male riders are the majority. Both male and female riders follow the same ride length pattern.  Interestingly riders who didnt input their gender went on longer rides on average.

### Trips by Weekday

These are the number of trips by day. Unsurprisingly weekday rides are heavily skewed around the standard 9-5 workday.  Weekend rides increase until around noon then taper off.

### Trips by Gender
![4](https://github.com/jpburgess/Citi-Bike/blob/main/images/trips%20by%20gender.PNG)
This is a gender breakdown of ridership by day.  Both male and female riders follow the same general trends as before.

### User Trips by Weekday
![5](https://github.com/jpburgess/Citi-Bike/blob/main/images/user%20trips%20by%20weekday.PNG)
This is a gender breakdown of ridership by day and user type. The large majority of riders are subscribers who use the bikes during the weekdays mostly.  Nonsubsribed users tend to use the bikes on the weekends.

### Top Starting Locations

This is a heatmap and sizemap of the most common starting locations.  Blue locations / larger locations have more riders.  

### Top Ending Locations
![7](https://github.com/jpburgess/Citi-Bike/blob/main/images/ending%20locations.PNG)
Same chart as before but now for ending locations.  There is very little change between starting and ending concentration.   On Manhattan most riders ride on the west side of the island and avaoid the east side.

## Summary
